- Class: text
  Output: Dear Taida students, welcome to my R and RStudio introduction course. Whenever you see three points below (e.g. `...`) then press the Enter-key to continue the lesson. Now press the Enter-key to continue.

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we`ll cover matrices and data frames. Both represent `rectangular` data types, meaning that they are used to store tabular data, with rows and columns.  

- Class: text
  Output: In social science rows are usually cases (e.g. respondents in a survey, tweets, users etc.). Columns are variables - representing characteristics or answers.

- Class: text
  Output: The main difference, as you'll see, is that matrices can only contain a single class of data, while data frames can consist of many different classes of data.
  
- Class: text
  Output: We will not really work with matrices but they are still important in R and we will briefly cover them here in the first part.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's create a vector containing the numbers 1 through 20 using the `:` operator. Store the result in a variable called my_vector with <-
  CorrectAnswer: my_vector <- 1:20
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_vector <- 1:20')
  Hint: Type 1:20 with no spaces. Make sure to use a regular colon and NOT a semi-colon. my_vector <- 1:20

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: View the contents of the vector you just created - just type the name of the object and hit enter
  CorrectAnswer: my_vector
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_vector')
  Hint: Type my_vector to view its contents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can always check the structure of an object using the str() function. Try that now with my_vector.
  CorrectAnswer: str(my_vector)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(my_vector)')
  Hint: Type str(my_vector).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The dim() function tells us the 'dimensions' of an object. What happens if we do dim(my_vector)? Give it a try.
  CorrectAnswer: dim(my_vector)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(my_vector)')
  Hint: Just type dim(my_vector) to see what happens.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Clearly, that`s not very helpful! Since my_vector is a vector, it doesn`t have a `dim` attribute (so it's just NULL), but we can find its length using the length() function. Try that now.
  CorrectAnswer: length(my_vector)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='length(my_vector)')
  Hint: Type length(my_vector) to view the length of the vector you just created. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Ah! That's what we wanted. But, what happens if we give my_vector a `dim` attribute? Let's give it a try. Type dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5)
  CorrectAnswer: dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5)')
  Hint: Type dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5) to give my_vector a `dim` attribute.

- Class: text
  Output: It's okay if that last command seemed a little strange to you. It should! The dim() function allows you to get OR set the `dim` attribute for an R object. In this case, we assigned the value c(4, 5) to the `dim` attribute of my_vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use dim(my_vector) to confirm that we've set the `dim` attribute correctly.
  CorrectAnswer: dim(my_vector)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(my_vector)')
  Hint: Just type dim(my_vector) to make sure the `dim` attribute has been set.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: View the contents of my_vector. To do that just type my_vector and hit Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: my_vector
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_vector')
  Hint: Type my_vector to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: But, wait! That doesn`t sound like a vector any more. Well, it`s not. Now it's a matrix. Just like in math class, when dealing with a 2-dimensional object (think rectangular table), the first number of dim is the number of rows (4) and the second is the number of columns (5). Therefore, we just gave my_vector 4 rows and 5 columns.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let`s confirm it's actually a matrix by using the class() function. Type class(my_vector) to see what I mean.
  CorrectAnswer: class(my_vector)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(my_vector)')
  Hint: Type class(my_vector) to view the class of my_vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Sure enough, my_vector is now a matrix. We should store it in a new object that helps us remember what it is. Store the value of my_vector in a new object called my_matrix.
  CorrectAnswer: my_matrix <- my_vector
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_matrix <- my_vector')
  Hint: Since we can't just change the name of our my_vector object, we'll assign its value to a new object with my_matrix <- my_vector.

- Class: text
  Output: The example that we've used so far was meant to illustrate the point that a matrix is simply an atomic vector with a dimension attribute. A more direct method of creating the same matrix uses the matrix() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Bring up the help file for the matrix() function now using the `?` function.
  CorrectAnswer: ?matrix
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?matrix')
  Hint: The command ?matrix will do the trick.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, look at the documentation for the matrix function and see if you can figure out how to create a matrix containing the same numbers (1-20) and dimensions (4 rows, 5 columns) by calling the matrix() function. Store the result in a variable called my_matrix2. Use 1:20 as an argument in matrix().
  CorrectAnswer: my_matrix2 <- matrix(1:20, nrow=4, ncol=5)
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value('matrix(1:20, nrow=4, ncol=5)'); expr_creates_var('my_matrix2')
  Hint: Call the matrix() function with three arguments -- 1:20, the number of rows, and the number of columns. Be sure to specify arguments by their proper names and store the result in my_matrix2 (not in my_matrix).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, let's confirm that my_matrix and my_matrix2 are actually identical. The identical() function will tell us if its first two arguments are the same. Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: identical(my_matrix, my_matrix2)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('identical(my_matrix, my_matrix2)', 'identical(my_matrix2, my_matrix)')
  Hint: If you're not sure about this one, then checkout the documentation for identical() using the `?` function.

- Class: text
  Output: Now, imagine that the numbers in our table represent some measurements from a Twitter analysis, where each row represents one user and each column represents one variable.

- Class: text
  Output: We may want to label the rows, so that we know which numbers belong to each user in our analysis. One way to do this is to add a column to the matrix, which contains the names of all four artist.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by creating a character vector containing the names of our artist -- "Drake", "Taylor Swift", "BTS", "Ed Sheeran". Use c() to combine them to a vector. Remember that double quotes tell R that something is a character string. Store the result in a variable called artist. You can directly copy the names from here.
  CorrectAnswer: artist <- c("Drake", "Taylor Swift", "BTS", "Ed Sheeran")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='artist <- c("Drake", "Taylor Swift", "BTS", "Ed Sheeran")')
  Hint: Make sure to copy each name (with the right capitalization) and to store the result in a variable called artist. Also, don't get the order of the artist mixed up! 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we`ll use the cbind() function to `combine columns`. Don't worry about storing the result in a new object for now. Just call cbind() with two arguments -- the artist vector and my_matrix.
  CorrectAnswer: cbind(artist, my_matrix)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cbind(artist, my_matrix)')
  Hint: Type cbind(artist, my_matrix) to add the names of our artist to the matrix of numbers.

- Class: text
  Output: Something is fishy about our result! It appears that combining the character vector with our matrix of numbers caused everything to be enclosed in double quotes. This means we're left with a matrix of character strings, which is no good.

- Class: text
  Output: If you remember back to the beginning of this lesson, I told you that matrices can only contain ONE class of data. Therefore, when we tried to combine a character vector with a numeric matrix, R was forced to 'coerce' the numbers to characters, hence the double quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: This is called `implicit coercion`, because we didn`t ask for it. It just happened. But why didn`t R just convert the names of our artist to numbers? I'll let you ponder that question on your own.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So, we're still left with the question of how to include the names of our artist in the table without destroying the integrity of our numeric data. Try the following -- my_data <- data.frame(artist, my_matrix)
  CorrectAnswer: my_data <- data.frame(artist, my_matrix)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_data <- data.frame(artist, my_matrix)')
  Hint: Type my_data <- data.frame(artist, my_matrix), so we can explore what happens.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now view the contents of my_data to see what we've come up with.
  CorrectAnswer: my_data
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_data')
  Hint: Type my_data to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: It looks like the data.frame() function allowed us to store our character vector of names right alongside our matrix of numbers. That's exactly what we were hoping for! 

- Class: text
  Output: Behind the scenes, the data.frame() function takes any number of arguments and returns a single object of class `data.frame` that is composed of the original objects.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's confirm this by calling the class() function on our newly created data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: class(my_data)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(my_data)')
  Hint: The class function takes one argument -- the object of which you want to determine the class.

- Class: text
  Output: It's also possible to assign names to the individual rows and columns of a data frame, which presents another possible way of determining which row of values in our table belongs to each user.

- Class: text
  Output: However, since we've already solved that problem, let's solve a different problem by assigning names to the columns of our data frame so that we know what type of measurement each column represents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since we have six columns (including artist), we'll need to first create a vector containing one element for each column. Create a character vector called cnames that contains the following values (in order) -- "artist", "genre", "followers.total", "popularity", "type", "id".
  CorrectAnswer: cnames <- c("artist", "genre", "followers.total", "popularity", "type", "id")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cnames <- c("artist", "artist", "followers.total", "popularity", "type", "id")')
  Hint: Make sure all of the names are lowercase, surrounded by double quotes, and separated with commas. Don't forget to use the c() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, use the colnames() function to set the `colnames` attribute for our data frame. This is similar to the way we used the dim() function earlier in this lesson. Use colnames() with my_data as argument and after the function add <- cnames
  CorrectAnswer: colnames(my_data) <- cnames
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='colnames(my_data) <- cnames')
  Hint: Try colnames(my_data) <- cnames.

  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's see if that got the job done. Print the contents of my_data.
  CorrectAnswer: my_data
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_data')
  Hint: Print the contents of my_data to the console.

- Class: text
  Output: We will now work with real data collected over the YouTub, Reddit, and Spotify API with the different packages. I have prepared some data for you - you can see it in the environment....

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can check the number of rows with nrow(). Try it with the object us_2022!
  CorrectAnswer: nrow(us_2022)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='nrow(us_2022)')
  Hint: Just use the function nrow and add us_2022 as argument.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now check what class the object has with the function class.
  CorrectAnswer: class(us_2022)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(us_2022)')
  Hint: Just use the function nrow and add us_2022 as argument.

- Class: text
  Output: As you can see it is a data frame and a tbl - which stands for tibble. Tibbles are more or less the same as data frames but subsetting works differently.

- Class: text
  Output: Some data-scientists prefer tibbles. However, most available code on the internet is still traditional - therefore we start with the `standard` way.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: An advantage of tibbles is the automatic summary function if you call the object. Just type us_2022 and call the object.
  CorrectAnswer: us_2022
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='us_2022')
  Hint: Just use the function nrow and add us_2022 as argument.  

- Class: text
  Output: You will always get only the first ten rows returned in the console with a nice summary.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let`s test subsetting. Use the box brackets [] to subset the ninth column which has the index number 9. Remember - [row,column]. Try to just call the ninth column
  CorrectAnswer: us_2022[ ,9]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='us_2022[ ,9]')
  Hint: type us_2022[ ,9]. Left we keep empty as we want all "rows" of column 9.  

- Class: text
  Output: As you can see - we get back a tibble with just one column and not a vector. Box brackets with index numbers always return a tibble! The same happens if you use us_2022[ ,"name"].

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: However, we can still subset a column as vector if we use the $ subset (mydf$name_of_column). Try to call the ninth column name of the tibble us_2022 with the $.
  CorrectAnswer: us_2022$name
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='us_2022$name')
  Hint: Just type us_2022$name 

- Class: text
  Output: Now we get a vector as you can see. With a data frame (not tibble) both approaches would have returned a vector - with tibbles only the $ subset works.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let`s check a preview of the data above in the source code window. Type View(us_2022)
  CorrectAnswer: View(us_2022)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(us_2022)')
  Hint: Just type View(us_2022). 
  
- Class: text
  Output: I was searching for tracks in the US market released in 2022 as search query to collect the tracks.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we focus on the logical data class. Try the explicit column. Let`s check with str(us_2022$explicit) what kind of data this column has.
  CorrectAnswer: str(us_2022$explicit)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(us_2022$explicit)')
  Hint: Type str(us_2022$explicit).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We have the data class logical. TRUE means obviously "is explicit". Try to directly subset all songs with this column. Use us_2022$explicit inside of the [] to select the songs with explicit content in the dataset.
  CorrectAnswer: us_2022$explicit[us_2022$explicit, ]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='us_2022$explicit[us_2022$explicit, ]')
  Hint: Type us_2022$explicit[us_2022$explicit, ]

- Class: text
  Output: You can always save your subsets in a new object with name_new_object <- ...

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now the last example with Spotify data - let`s try the table function with the column artist_name_first. Subset the column artist_name_first of the us_2022 object and use it as argument inside of table()
  CorrectAnswer: table(us_2022$artist_name_first)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(us_2022$artist_name_first)')
  Hint: Just type table(us_2022$artist_name_first)
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now you can see how many tracks we have for each artists. In the following weeks you will learn how to visualize this kind of data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we switch to data covering YouTube. Let`s check a preview of the data above in the source code window. Type View(yt_taiwan_comment)
  CorrectAnswer: View(yt_taiwan_comment)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(yt_taiwan_comment)')
  Hint: Just type View(yt_taiwan_comment).   

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Scroll a little to the right - we focus now on the column parentId. Subset this column with the $ and save it in a new object called reply.
  CorrectAnswer: reply <- yt_taiwan_comment$parentId
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='reply <- yt_taiwan_comment$parentId')
  Hint: Just type reply <- yt_taiwan_comment$parentId. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: NA value means no value available. All NA are not replies.  If there is value it is a reply to a specific comment. Let`s check the first 150 values of reply with 1:150 and []
  CorrectAnswer: reply[1:150]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='reply[1:150]')
  Hint: Use the reply object together with the subset [1:150]. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Very few replies in our dataset - but at least a few among the first 150 comments. Let`s use the is.na() function together with reply as argument. 
  CorrectAnswer: is.na(reply)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='is.na(reply)')
  Hint: Just type is.na(reply). 
  
- Class: text
  Output: is.na() yields a vector of logical values the same length as reply, with TRUEs corresponding to NA values in replies and FALSEs corresponding to non-NA values in reply.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's start by indexing with logical vectors. One common scenario when working with real-world data is that we want to extract all elements of a vector that are NA. Recall that is.na(reply) yields a vector of logical values the same length as reply, with TRUEs corresponding to NA values in reply and FALSEs corresponding to non-NA values in reply.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you think reply[is.na(reply)] will give you?
  AnswerChoices: A vector of all NAs (ids of replied comments); A vector with no NAs (ids of replied comments); A vector of all NAs (no ids of replied comments); A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs; A vector of length 0
  CorrectAnswer: A vector of all NAs (no ids of replied comments)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="A vector of all NAs (no ids of replied comments)")
  Hint: Remember that is.na(replies) tells us where the NAs are in a vector. NA means here no reply - thus no ids. So if we subset x based on that, what do you expect to happen?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Prove it to yourself by typing reply[is.na(reply)].
  CorrectAnswer: reply[is.na(reply)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='reply[is.na(reply)]')
  Hint: Type reply[is.na(reply)] to see that you get all NAs.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The operator `!` gives us the negation of a logical expression, so !is.na(x) can be read as `is not NA`. Type reply[!is.na(reply)]. Give it a try.
  CorrectAnswer: reply[!is.na(reply)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='reply[!is.na(reply)]')
  Hint: Type reply[!is.na(reply)] to capture all non-missing values from reply.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let`s subset now directly all replies. We now directly call the column with yt_taiwan_comment$parentId. We use !is.na(yt_taiwan_comment$parentId) and put it as subset for the rows. Type yt_taiwan_comment[!is.na(yt_taiwan_comment$parentId), ]
  CorrectAnswer: yt_taiwan_comment[!is.na(yt_taiwan_comment$parentId), ]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='yt_taiwan_comment[!is.na(yt_taiwan_comment$parentId), ]')
  Hint: Type yt_taiwan_comment[!is.na(yt_taiwan_comment$parentId), ].

- Class: text
  Output: As you can see, we now have selected only replies (see the relevant columns in the console).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now follows the last part. Let`s check a preview of video data from YouTube. Type View(yt_taiwan_stats)
  CorrectAnswer: View(yt_taiwan_stats)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(yt_taiwan_stats)')
  Hint: Just type View(yt_taiwan_stats). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's focus on the column - created_at. Check the max value in this column with max() and $ subset.
  CorrectAnswer: max(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='max(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at)')
  Hint: Just type max(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: That is the newest video. Check the min value in this column with min() and $ subset.
  CorrectAnswer: min(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='min(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at)')
  Hint: Just type min(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use both functions together and subtract the min value from the max value with min() and max() ... max() - min()
  CorrectAnswer: max(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at) - min(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='max(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at) - min(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at)')
  Hint: Just type max(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at) - min(yt_taiwan_stats$created_at). 

- Class: text
  Output: As you can see, we cover ... with the videos I was searching for the keyword Taiwan on Youtube

- Class: text
  Output: Important points this week - difference between data frames and matrices, use the $ when subsetting tibbles if you want a vector, how to use is.na(), what kind of data we get back from the different APIs.

- Class: text
  Output: That's it! Next week you will download your own data - stay tuned!
